    E 8.8.1: Test in GHCi: fact 10000 and fact 100000 . What takes longer, calculating the number or printing all of its digits?
    A   : It seems like it takes longer printing all of its digits


    Q 8.13.1: Enumerate:
            - 2 differences between Elm and Haskell

                1. Haskell can import all except a type or function
                2. Haskell support list comprehentions, Elm doesn't
                    funny, since Haskell descourages its use

            - 2 features of Haskell that are not present in SML

                1. List comprehention
                2. lazy evaluation

            - 2 features of SML that are not present in Haskell

                1. it supports mutable references and exceptions
                2. semantics are formally specified and verified
