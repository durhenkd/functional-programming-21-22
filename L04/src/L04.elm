    Q 4.1.1 How can we prevent a type from being instantiated in uncontrolled ways in Java?
    A:  I really don't know

    A: Yes

{- E 4.6.9 You may have noticed that the createDate function is not always correct: it doesnâ€™t handle leap years!
            1. Modify the Date.elm module, by adding a new function with the signature
                isLeapYear : Int -> Bool , that checks if a given year between 1970 and 3000 is a leap year.
            2. Then modify the daysInMonth function to account for leap years.
            3. Finally update the createDate function to use the corrected version of daysInMonth 
            
            Hint: You should change the signature to daysInMonth : Month -> Int -> Int , where the second
                parameter is the year. -}
